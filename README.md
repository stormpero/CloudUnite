### Development of a web application for centralized management of cloud services

## Why do we need this app?
The proposed work is the development of a web application for managing multiple cloud platforms, providing a convenient way to manage files in different clouds. This would allow users to work with various cloud services through a single platform, which would simplify the management, monitoring and control of their cloud storage. With the growing popularity and widespread use of many cloud platforms, the need for a centralized and optimized approach to managing these resources has become an important requirement. Thus, the development of a web application for managing multiple clouds would provide significant benefits to users, making cloud management more efficient and practical.
